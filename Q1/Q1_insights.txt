Insights about the data : 
1. The data distribution of temperature and vibration is significantly different, so we need to normalize the data
2. The data has unbalanced label of 0 and 1. So, the train_test split must be done correctly bu using "stratisfy" option on sklearn split function
3. Because the data is unbalanced, the metrics we should use to quantify the performance is f1 score
