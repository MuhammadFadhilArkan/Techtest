Both train and validation set has matthews_correlation = 1. This means that our model can predict perfectly, and able to generalize perfectly as well.

Note : matthews_correlation is a metrics used to evaluate an unbalanced dataset. for more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthews_correlation_coefficient
